- File named 'StationDetails.csv' - Were the data was dowldoad from 'Historic Data - Met Eireann - The Irish Meteorologic Service'.
- File named - 'Cleaned_StationDetails.csv' - Before analyze the data base, I had cleared and normalized the data base.
- Notebook named project.ipynb - were demonstrate all the analyses that I had realized in the data.
- README.md - description about this repository.
- wind_resource_map - interative map that you can use in the analyse. This will open when you clone this repository to VSC.
